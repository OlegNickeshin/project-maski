This project, including its structure, terminology, and ontological logic, is authored by Oleg. Any use of its core conceptual framework must refer to the original idea.

“Masks” is not just code — it is a meta-philosophical identity system built to discern, activate, and protect conscious roles in a chaotic world.

Digital identifiers, internal codes, and role mappings are intellectual property under protection by authorship and logic of the project.
