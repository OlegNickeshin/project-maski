# Ontological Structure of “Masks”

## Core Concepts

- **Mask**: A conscious role that a person may activate.
- **Code**: A hidden identifier linking behavior with identity.
- **Types**: Prophet, Builder, Skeptic, Voice, Fire, Architect, Mirror, etc.

## System Layers

1. Identity (who speaks)
2. Function (why it speaks)
3. Activation (how it manifests)

## Principles

- Multiple masks per person.
- Recognition via speech/thought patterns.
- System reveals, not judges.
- Only Oleg assigns core codes.
